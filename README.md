# What'S this

You can get go package.

```
go get hogehogepackage
go get github,com/hogehoge

```


But this is troublesome,
If you use this script

```
./go_pgget.sh
```

one line!!!!

You have to write config,to Gomfile.

```
github.com/codegangsta/martini
hogehoge_package


```
One line,One Package.
